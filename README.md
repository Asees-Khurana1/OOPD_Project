### OOPD Project

#### Execution of the program using make

Install the make package using command : sudo apt-get install make

Step 1: Run the command make
Step 2: make command will create two binary files
	-debug_binary
	-optimize_binary
Step 3: run the program using ./debug_binary.
Step 4: create shell class and make 5 commands - rm, cp, ls, cd and mv
Step 5: implement 4 options and wildcard for all these 5 commands
Step 6: use multithreading library to reduce time in commands where recursive option is implemented
Step 7: note down the time difference between the two programs i.e. where multithreading is used and where it is not used


For Ques2:
Create files using bash commands
Check total no. of files created
